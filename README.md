# feelio - social media project

this is my social app i'm building for my portfolio. using react + vite cuz create-react-app is too slow lol

## how to run:

- `npm run skibidi` for dev server
- `npm run build` to build the thing
- `npm run smt` to build and deploy

still working on the backend stuff, but the frontend is coming along ok
