# Adorio Development and Production Setup Guide

## Overview

This project is configured to work in local development and on Render.

## Environment Configuration

### Development Environment

- **Command**: `npm run dev`
- **Frontend**: Runs on `http://localhost:5173` (or 5174 if 5173 is busy)
- **Backend**: Runs on `http://localhost:3000`
- **Environment File**: `.env.development` for both frontend and backend
- **Database**: Uses production MongoDB (same as Render)

### Production Environment (Render)

- **Frontend**: Deployed to `https://your-frontend-url.github.io`
- **Backend**: Deployed to `https://your-backend.onrender.com`
- **Environment**: Render injects environment variables directly
- **Database**: Production MongoDB cluster

## Available Commands

### Development Commands

```bash
npm run dev         # Start both frontend and backend in development
npm run frontend    # Start only frontend (Vite dev server)
npm run backend     # Start only backend (nodemon)
npm run test-env    # Test environment configuration
```

### Production Commands

```bash
npm start           # Start backend in production mode (used by Render)
npm run build       # Build frontend for production
npm run preview     # Preview production build locally
npm run test-prod   # Test production environment configuration
npm run prod        # Run in production mode locally (testing)
```

## Protected Routes Setup

### Authentication Requirements

- **All pages require login** except for:
  - `/login` - Login page
  - `/register` - Registration page
  - `/sendenv` - Special utility page (kept unprotected as requested)

### Redirect behavior

- When accessing protected routes without login → redirects to `/login`
- After successful login → redirects to originally requested page
- Login/Register forms remember intended destination
- Cross-navigation between login/register preserves destination

## Environment Variables

### Render Backend Environment (Example)

```env
CLIENT_URL=https://your-frontend-url.github.io
CLOUDINARY_KEY=your_cloudinary_key
CLOUDINARY_NAME=your_cloudinary_name
CLOUDINARY_SECRET=your_cloudinary_secret
JWT_SECRET="your_jwt_secret_here"
MONGO_URI="mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/dbname"
NODE_ENV=production
VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://your-backend.onrender.com
VITE_CLOUDINARY_NAME=your_cloudinary_name
```

### Local Development Files

- **Frontend**: `.env.development` → Points to `http://localhost:3000`
- **Backend**: `backend/.env.development` → Points to `http://localhost:5173`

> **🔒 Security Note**: The example above shows placeholder values. Your actual environment variables should be kept secure and never committed to version control.

## CORS Configuration

Your backend automatically allows requests from:

- `https://your-frontend-url.github.io` (your Render frontend)
- `http://localhost:5173` & `http://localhost:5174` (local development)

## What is configured

### Local development

- `npm run dev` starts both frontend and backend
- Frontend connects to local backend (`localhost:3000`)
- Backend serves frontend requests with proper CORS
- Environment variables load correctly

### Production

- Render deployment continues to work normally
- Environment detection works for cloud platforms
- No impact on existing production setup
- All your Render environment variables are properly handled

### Route protection

- Every page requires authentication except SendEnv
- Smart redirects preserve user's intended destination
- Login/Register flow works with protected routes

## Important Notes

1. **Render Deployment**: Your production environment uses `npm start` and will continue working exactly as before. The environment loading logic detects when running on Render and uses the injected environment variables.

2. **Local Development**: Use `npm run dev` to run frontend and backend together.

3. **Production Testing**: Run `npm run test-prod` to verify your production environment configuration is correct.

4. **Environment Testing**: Run `npm run test-env` to check current environment configuration.

5. **Database**: Both development and production use the same MongoDB cluster. Consider setting up a separate development database if needed.

## Troubleshooting

### If Render deployment fails:

1. Check that all environment variables are set in Render dashboard
2. Verify the build command is correct
3. Run `npm run test-env` locally to test configuration

### If local development doesn't work:

1. Ensure ports 3000 and 5173 are available
2. Check that `.env.development` files exist
3. Run `npm run test-env` to verify environment setup

### If CORS errors occur:

1. Check that your frontend URL is in the allowed origins
2. Verify the backend is running on the expected port
3. Make sure environment variables match between frontend and backend

Your application should now run in both development and production with route protection enabled (except SendEnv).
